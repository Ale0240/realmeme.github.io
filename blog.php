	<p style="font-size: 20px">Inorder increase our thinking capacity  we should consider the following things :<br>
1.The first one is to focus , <br>focus is the main thing that will going to help us increase our thinking capacity by helping us to only think about one specific thing this kind of focus will help us remove distracion and think about the one thing that we want to think about . when focus on only one thing our thinking ability to perform that action will be increased massively. so focus is the first step to increase our thinking capacity.<br>2.The next thing that we have to consider that is going to help us boost our intellegence is that getting enough sleep through out the night.<br>As we all know human beings should sleep at least 8 hours per day if we do that we might be able to increase our thinking capacity and this is the main thing to consider because sleeping without stress is the best thing to do for our mind to increase our intellegence and also keep our health good .<br><u>so  do you get enough sleep at night ? or do you have some kind of stress going on at night? </u>and <br>3.The other thing is that to get enough food .<br>In order to think clearly you should be eating healthy food because you do not want to worry about your stomach when you have work to do . so as I just said eating health is the main thing to consider for your brain to work. <br>4.The next thing is that stress.<br> I mean decreasing or removing stress.Over stress is the basic factor that is ruining most of human kind lives by taking their mind off and  making them do things that they should not have done.So how can we decrease this stress to help us boost our intellegence?<br> here is how -if you are getting stress what you should do is that make your self busy this will help you focus on your work and help you think straight because when you are busy you won't think about the stress that you want to stress about. This will work but if it does not work or its does not help you can start doing exersice and focusing on a change or going out to play games or taking a walk with friends or may be you just needed a vacation so take one for a week this will put your mind at ease.<br>5.The last but not list is caffine(coffee,tea) this drinks will help you focus and help you to increase your thinking capacity more than you thing. I hope this helps if you have any suggesionor comment on my blog or about my website <a href="contactpage.php">contact me</a></p>
